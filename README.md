# My Personal VIM Config

## Config is setup using Vundle Plugin Manager

To install Vundle:
https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim


## Step 1:
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
## Step 2:
Copy the ```.vimrc``` in this repo into your ~ folder (root).
```
cp .vimrc ~
```
NOTE: On Windows ```~``` might be something like C:\Users\username\Vim82

## Step 3:
Open Vim and type ```:PluginInstall```

## Step 4 (Optional Config for Gvim):
Add a ```.gvimrc``` in the same directory as ```.vimrc``` and add the same text within that file.

## Step 5:
Save and re-open Vim/Gvim. You should be good to go!
